 * Data to synchronize and serailize.
 * Distributed synchronization: RMI facilitates communication and clock updates between processes.
â€¢ Scalability: The design allows for adding more processes without significant changes.
  Serialization of objects for RMI communication, and thread synchronization for concurrent access to vector clocks.
